# 0.4.0 is here

It has been a while since the last release of Cake.Gem, and this release doesn't really add any new functionality, but it brings with it a number of improvements to the build process, and also allows this addin to work in the soon to be released 0.18.0 version of Cake.

This release includes the following:

- [__#19__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Gem/issues/19) Switch away from using gep13.DefaultBuild and use Cake.Recipe instead

## Documentation
